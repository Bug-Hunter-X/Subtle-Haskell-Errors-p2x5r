This repository contains examples of uncommon and subtle errors in Haskell code that can be difficult to detect.  The `bug.hs` file demonstrates a compilation error caused by a seemingly innocuous extra space.  `bugSolution.hs` offers the corrected version.  These examples highlight the importance of careful attention to detail when writing Haskell code.
